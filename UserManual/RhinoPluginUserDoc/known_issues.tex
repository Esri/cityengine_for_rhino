\section{Known Issues}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Only the default theme rule attributes are supported. Additional styles are currently ignored.
    \item A Grasshopper error triggered when changing the rule package, if the new one has less rule attributes than the previous one. It does however not crash, just press \textit{OK} and the component will continue correctly.\\
